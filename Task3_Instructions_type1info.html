<p>
    <b>Type 1: Color Information </b> <br>
    <b>Test Scores:</b> The 10 questions you just completed before this instruction are often used as non-verbal tests of intelligence. Scores on these IQ questions are ranked among today’s participants from highest (top, 1st) to lowest (bottom, 8th). Tie scores are broken randomly.
    </p>
<p>
    <b>Color Marking:</b> At the beginning of each round, the computer first randomly sorts all 8 traders into 4 pairs (2 traders each pair). In each pair, the trader with a higher (resp. lower) rank on the ten IQ questions is assigned to the H (resp. L) group. Then, the computer will randomly determine the true value of \(\theta\). As shown in Figure 1, when \(\theta > 0\), the H-group traders will be marked as <b style="color:Green;">Green</b>  and L-group traders will be marked as <b style="color:red;">Red</b>; the marking will be reversed if \(\theta < 0\).

<p>
    You will NOT know whether you were assigned to the H or L group. But you will be told your group’s color (this is your color information) after the true value of \(\theta\) is determined. Your color may help you guess how likely that \(\theta \) is greater than 0.
