<p>
    In this experiment, you are going to predict the realized value, denoted as Œ∏, of a hypothetical asset. Its value follows a randomly distributed variable following the normal distribution: Œ∏ ‚àº ùëÅ(0,1). If you are not familiar with the normal distribution, here is some basic information about it.

</p>
<p>
    The shape of the normal distribution is a bell curve. The mean of Œ∏ is 0, and its variance is 1. This means that (as shown in the above Figure 1) <br>
    (1) the probably that the realization of Œ∏ lies between [-1, 1] is 68%; <br>
    (2) the probably that the realization of Œ∏ lies between [-2, 2] is 95%; and <br>
    (3) the probably that the realization of Œ∏ lies between [-3, 3] is 99.7%.<br>
    <b>
        It is equally likely that the true value of Œ∏ is either greater or smaller than the mean zero. Also, the probability that the realization of Œ∏ is close to the mean 0 is larger than the probability that it is far away from the mean.
    </b>
    The realization of the true value, Œ∏, is drawn at the beginning of each round, but you don‚Äôt see the realized value immediately. Instead, you predict the value of Œ∏ in each round based on two types of information (explained in Part 2) that help you guess the true value.
